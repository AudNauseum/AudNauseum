# AudNauseum

AudNauseum is a software emulated loop-based digital recorder/sampler or audio looper for short. Simply put, an audio looper is a device that can record audio into a track while simultaneously playing all recorded tracks, often used by musicians to layer background tracks or to create harmonies with only their own voice and instruments. The audio looper can read and write loops from and to its disk storage, and contains a number of effects that can be used to alter the currently playing or recorded audio.

## Tell Me More...

Upon program startup a default audio loop is loaded with zero tracks and the user is ready to begin recording or add pre-recorded audio files to a repeating loop. For fans of the movie Pitch Perfect 3, [the scene in which the lead actress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yooREhMwzFc) is using a percussion pad (drum beat simulator) while recording audio vocals in DJ Khaled’s hotel room you are seeing an audio looper in action. The same is true here, you can press record and lay down a beat acapella style or sing your favorite tune, press stop and the track is saved.

Click add track and you can navigate to your recorded track and add that to the loop. Press play to hear your beats or vocal track played back. Now is where you can get creative, while playing back the vocals you can press record to record a new beat over top of your previously recorded track. Have a cool sound byte or music track you want to overlay a beat or vocal recording? Import .wav files to the “resources/recordings folder” and you can add those tracks to the looper too!

## How do I run AudNauseum?

Please see the [documentation file](docs/Running_From_Source.md) on running the AudNauseum application from source code.

## Is There a Standalone Application?

Not yet -- the only way to run the application currently is from the source code. We may look into packaging and distributing the application as a standalone program/executable in the future for different platforms.
